Welcome to **V.I.S.A.G.E.**, a resource for extending [**`ggplot2`**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and the [**`tidyverse`**](https://www.tidyverse.org) to create stunning visualizations, perform geo-computation, and analyze complex data. Built using [**`R`**](https://www.r-project.org) and [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/rstudio/), this site demonstrates how packages like [**`sf`**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), various ggplot2 extensions, and other tools in the tidyverse enhance data manipulation and visualization. Explore dynamic graphs, interactive maps, and reproducible workflows built with [**`Quarto`**](https://quarto.org/) to see how modern tools can turn data into insights.
