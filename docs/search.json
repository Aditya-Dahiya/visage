    "text": "Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m Dr. Aditya Dahiya, your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast. With an MBBS from AIIMS, New Delhi and a Master of Public Health from Harvard University, I’ve always had a penchant for diving deep into the intricacies of data—and what better way to do that than with ggplot2, its myriad extensions and other open-source packages.\nWhen I’m not navigating the labyrinth of Haryana’s bureaucracy (don’t worry, I have a map!), I channel my experiences as a Fulbright Fellow into making data visualization a captivating storytelling tool. Think of me as your data-wrangling, file-taming, bureaucracy-battling guide with a slightly skewed sense of humor. Need more bureaucratic banter or data insights? Connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email — I promise it won’t be as formal as a government memo!"
