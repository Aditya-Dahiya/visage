### 1. **WGS 84 (Geographic)**

The WGS 84 projection, identified by **EPSG:4326**, is the default geographic coordinate system used for latitude and longitude. It is the most common system for raw geographic data and is widely used in GPS devices and mapping applications. This projection is excellent for datasets that involve global coverage but does not preserve area, shape, or distance due to its geographic nature.

```{r}

g <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world) +
  coord_sf(
    crs = "EPSG:4326"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "WGS 84 (Geographic) Projection",
    subtitle = "EPSG:4326. Default geographic coordinate system using latitude and longitude."
  )

ggsave(
  plot = g,
  filename = here::here("geocomputation", "images",
                        "crs_projections_1.png"),
  height = 1200,
  width = 1800,
  units = "px"
)
```

![WGS 84 (Geographic) Projection](images/crs_projections_1.png){#fig-1}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Web Mercator**

The Web Mercator projection, represented by **EPSG:3857**, is widely used by web mapping platforms like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. It is a conformal projection, meaning it preserves angles but distorts area, especially near the poles. It is best suited for interactive maps or raster tiles for visualizing data at various zoom levels.

::: callout-note
Antarctica cannot be plotted with Web Mercator projection, as it become hugely elongated. Must remove Antarctica before plotting in Web Mercator.
:::

```{r}

g <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = world |> 
      filter(name != "Antarctica")
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    crs = "EPSG:3857"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Web Mercator Projection",
    subtitle = "EPSG:3857. Best for interactive Maps; preserves angles."
  )

ggsave(
  plot = g,
  filename = here::here("geocomputation", "images",
                        "crs_projections_2.png"),
  height = 1200,
  width = 1800,
  units = "px"
)
```

### 3. **UTM Zone 33N**

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 33N, identified by **EPSG:32633**, is a projection system designed for mapping specific regions with minimal distortion. UTM divides the world into 6° longitudinal zones, and Zone 33N is suited for areas within its coverage, typically in Europe. It is ideal for regional-scale analysis and detailed mapping.

::: callout-note
In order to be able to use `xlim = c(-20, 45)`, and `ylim = c(33, 70)` within the `coord_sf()`, to focus on Europe, we must use `default_crs = sf::st_crs(4326)`. The `deafult_crs` argument tells the *ggplot2* that the limits' numbers are mentioned in which CRS system. And, the `4326` CRS is the default longitude-latitude CRS system.
:::

```{r}

g <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = world |> 
      filter(continent == "Europe")
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    crs = "EPSG:32633"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "UTM Zone 33N Projection: For Europe",
    subtitle = "Minimal distortion for European Region."
  )

ggsave(
  plot = g,
  filename = here::here("geocomputation", "images",
                        "crs_projections_3_1.png"),
  height = 1200,
  width = 1800,
  units = "px"
)

g <- world |> 
  filter(continent == "Europe") |> 
  filter(!(name %in% c("Russia", "Iceland"))) |> 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf_text(
    mapping = aes(label = name),
    check_overlap = TRUE,
    size = 1.5
  ) +
  coord_sf(
    crs = "EPSG:32633",
    xlim = c(-20, 45),
    ylim = c(33, 70),
    default_crs = sf::st_crs(4326)
  ) +

  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "UTM Zone 33N Projection: For Europe",
    subtitle = "Minimal distortion for European Region."
  )

                        "crs_projections_3.png"),
  height = 1200,
  width = 1800,
  units = "px"
